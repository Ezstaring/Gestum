# Gestum

**Gestum** is an individual web application for **student and university task & project management**, designed and built with a **modular and scalable architecture**.

The goal of this project is to strengthen real-world backend engineering skills through a clean REST API, solid persistence design, and professional version control practices.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- RESTful backend built with **Java + Spring Boot**.
- Modular structure focused on **scalability** and maintainability.
- Persistence layer using **PostgreSQL** (relational) and **MongoDB** (document).
- Emphasis on good practices: clean code, clear separation of concerns, and evolvable design.
- Version control and collaboration-ready workflow with **Git/GitHub**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Area | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Backend | Java, Spring Boot |
| API | REST (Spring Web) |
| Databases | PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| Persistence | Spring Data (JPA for PostgreSQL / MongoDB module) |
| Frontend (basic) | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |
| Build Tool | Maven or Gradle |

## 📦 Planned Modules (In progress)

- [ ] Authentication & user management (registration, login, roles)
- [ ] Projects (create, update, archive)
- [ ] Tasks (CRUD, priorities, due dates)
- [ ] Status/Workflow (e.g., To Do / Doing / Done)
- [ ] Progress overview (dashboard-style)
- [ ] Notifications / reminders (future)

---

## 🧠 Architecture Notes

Gestum is being developed with a modular approach so each feature can evolve independently (domain separation, maintainable packages, and clear boundaries between API, business logic, and persistence).

---

## 🛠️ Status

**Actively in development.**

---

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Define MVP scope (core modules and rules)
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Validate persistence strategy (PostgreSQL vs MongoDB per use case)
- [ ] Improve API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Add tests (unit/integration)
